    <h1>Well Hello There World!</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <p> With this paragraph I am both testing my ability to add new elements to my html file and see if it properly displays on my page. yay!</p>
    <p>Next i will be trying to add some images and lnks and just see if they display properly. After that i will play around with their positioning on the page and just see what I can do! Also this second paragraph is for testing my ability to grab elements of the same type and manipulate them seperately. practice makes perfect</p>
